Jasper de Jong Tableau COVID dashboard

In this project I combined some SQL querying with Tableau to create a dashboard with some information regarding COVID infections and deaths in different continents and I looked at some data in the countries where I have lived.

The public Tableau dasboard can be found at this link: <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/COVID_portfolio/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link" target = "_blank"> Tableau COVID dashboard </a>.
