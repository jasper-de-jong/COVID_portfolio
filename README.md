Jasper de Jong Tableau COVID dashboard

In this project I combined SQL querying in Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio with Tableau to create a dashboard showing information regarding COVID infections and deaths in different continents. I also looked at data  on infections and deaths in the countries where I have lived.
